"""i must have chosen correct cause i got a congratulation saying i was the millionth person to download the file and to click here to claim my free ipad"" "
It is said that he who holds the Sacred Chalice of Ad-block shall find the One Button.
"If you need help, just use the Ask toolbar!"
"This really bothers me.

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade the dude didn't get his face melted off after choosing poorly, he just started aging really fast until he shriveled up into dust.

Raiders is where dudes' faces melted off."
The one with the magnet.

How about hovering your mouse over all of them to see where they lead you to? No? Noone does that?
It's fucking infuriating! I have gotten a lot better at recognizing the bullshit though.
"unless it's one of those pages where the first click, no matter where on the page, will always open a new tab of ad. After that, the 2nd click will work... assuming you picked the right button"
#adblock
"Just click and drag it. If it doesn't follow your cursor, it's an ad.

edit: it works in most cases, not always"
"There are so many ways to tell which to click. Look at the status bar. Hover cursor and look for bubble pop-up text. Right click, copy link location, paste into address bar but don't hit enter. Use a virtual machine. Use a friends PC. Use grandma's PC. Don't be a dumbass kids."
Cnet_download_manager.exe
"Let me recount the time my step-mother clicked countless of these buttons, trying to follow her ""hacker-friend's"" instructions to generate a windows key.  Also, as a note, I sure as hell didn't want to do this. Unfortunately, she and my father didn't want me to buy my own Windows key like a sane, normal person.
  
She was supposed to turn off my antivirus, and click three things, and then follow a few steps.  
  
Instead, she clicked every download button and every link on every website, opened several dozen Mozilla Firefox tabs, installed a dangerously idiotic amount of programs, until I finally told her to get up and step away from the desk.  
  
By the time she was finished, the mouse barely worked, it took ten minutes to load most webpages, and after turning on Avast and covering my ears for a few minutes, she had racked up an impressive *five-thousand and twenty-seven infected files*. Malware, spyware, adware, trojans, viruses of all sizes and shapes, my PC could have been used as a hub, a carrier for every sort of malicious anything ever.  
  
I don't know how someone does that. But she did it. *It happened.*"
"The worst is when it's not even the first button. You got to hope for one in the middle, mouse-over it and hope it doesn't get too excited."
"Hold and drag. Fake buttons will drag their image with them, the true button will drag the link."

Click the 'Download Magnet' button.
Adblock plus has been getting some hate lately but this is exactly what it puts an end to.
If you pray to Lord add block then there is but one choice 
I always choose the wrong one
Couchtuner & putlocker for those who need sites and haven't seen these
The one with the Batman symbol
*watch as free user* ~ click
It's a lie! The real link is always plain text!
copy the hash
"Round one, top center.  No arrow.  Tis the true button."
"ublock.

You'll thank me.

Also, for mobile, firefox for android and install add on ublock.

Works great."
"or the button is not even there and it's a timer, every button is false"
Click and drag. The one without any transparent background is the real one.
"The real button won't move if you drag it. So if it moves, it's an ad."
"THIS is one of the key reasons it is still not possible for someone to be nailed for 'illegal downloading'.

Love it."
"I only see one button, Adblock must be working"
So literally sourceforge

"I did this test separately with my mom and older sister when I installed software on their computer. ""Okay, this is a test. Which download button would you click, the giant green one or the little grey one?"" [They both failed.](http://i.imgur.com/m08y3Ke.jpg)"
"it's probably the ""download"" button."
You know what would be a good movie to pirate? Ice Age: The Meltdown
"Hold and drag. Fake buttons will drag their image with them, the true button will drag the link."
Adblock
Every time i show someone how to use torrent sites 
"It's so easy. 


If you right click the button it will tell you the link that it leads to."
why is this not Indiana Jones?
[Relevant](https://xkcd.com/272/)
you clicked... poorly.
"The magnet, choose the magnet"
THEY'RE ALL DOWNVOTES
Hahaha. I have an unfair advantage. I've been playing this game since before the false buttons. 
adblock!
"Let's be honest though, the correct button is probably hidden underneath those buttons. "
It requires an IQ over 45 to determine which one.
the real one isnt even a button. it's just plain blue text.
Two words: magnet links.
"It's an old button...it hasn't been used in months because nobody finds it...It's a button someone made to hide his film...a button to access the treasure...I should go for the smal grey button...not the big green one...

Damnit !! Forex commercial...."
Slacker Bobby and the Last Torrent
adblock
"This is why I run adblock.  Only one button, the true button shows for me. "
I look forward to the day that nobody gets this joke because we all know better. 
Just find the torrent hash or magnet link and copy it. Don't click *any* download links unless you're 100% sure it's the torrent file.
/r/sad
"Only the penitent man shall pass...

There! That's the download button of a carpenter."
The wrong button plays grindcore apparently
Its always the least compressed image
Its the button of a carpenter.
"No, no, no no... (no.. the button was not the comments button"
"\*Clicks adblock button\*

AH THERE IT IS!"
"Invoking `document.querySelectorAll(""a[href*=""+document.location.host+""]>img"")` I find the true button to be the circular one behind the grail knight."
"If you're not sure, click and drag it. If you can drag it, don't click it. "
"I've always found that hovering over the download button and reading the url it displays usually helps. 9 times outta 10, the correct url will link you to the website you're already on."
This is why you always have ad blocker.
Ahhh the joys of having to download from sourceforge!
Adblock etc. I always choose wisely.
"In a perfect world, you could phone a friend or get 50/50."
I didn't know there was a caption until I scrolled down further. It's funnier without the caption.
"Use the magnet link, Luke!

USE THE MAGNET LINK!"
The one with the Batman symbol
"Click, hold and drag. If it comes, let it be gone, if it stays, that's the right choice."
"Bitch please, just use the Pirate Bay"
"Downloading u_have_chosen_p00rly.exe

0 seconds remaining..."
speaking of which.. anyone got a link for streaming movies? my life is in shambles since movietube got shut down.
"It's none of them, you have to scroll all the way past those download links to the very bottom where you won't find a button, but simply some highlighted text amongst the wall of plain text. That is the holy grail."
its the only one that cant be clicked and dragged.
"So did people just stop using Adblock, or what"
"Have you heard of our Lord and savior, ad block?"
This needs to be a movie.
The second highest one on the upper right looks like an old man's limp dick. Can't tell if on purpose.
Add block ftw 
Reminds me of Indiana Jones.
"Remember kids, it's the blinking button that vibrates, it's font is on comic sans or impact, it's much bigger than it needs to be, it's close button it's very small and transparent, and is capable of showing up twice in the same page!"
Ublock origin
It's the small rectangle in the middle right
TIL most people on reddit pirate things.

Ahh I used to have this problem. The Ad Blocker extension for chrome gets rid of everything but the working link. 
"A tip: If you can drag the image, then it isn't a link."
"Obviously it's the one labeled ""download"" duhh"
You chose...  porn.ly 
"It's always the one that's linked, underlined and simply says ,""download here."""
The real one is a hyperlink.
"Look for the magnet, folks "
"get linux, if it doesn't download, then no big deal."
it's button 5
It's a trick.  Your download will start automatically after 10 seconds.
Adblock
We call it minesweeper. 
"If you're not sure, click and drag it. If you can drag it, don't click it. "
or you could just at the hyperlink it will take you too.
This is what the next year's the button will be.
The one that doesn't have the hand is the right one.
Magnet link icon is always the answer.
The struggle is real 
I always try to just do the right click and save as trick. 
I heard you can drag it and if it moves then its the false button.
Looking at you Kickasstorrents!
People really just need to get an ad blocker..
"I recently introduced my father to torrenting,  Sending him this now."
"But which one will give me number, color, and flair?"
Complete a Survey first!
Pirate movie or Minecraft mod. The bastards prey on the youngest if us...
Do you even ad block plus? 
"""He chose....poorly."""
Unless you get adblocker
he chose...poorly...
If you hover over a button and look at the bottom of the screen (in Chrome at least) it'll show you what site the button leads to. From there its pretty obvious how to find the real button.
"Just click and drag, my friends. Just click and drag. "

We have all dealt with this."
This is pretty much www.sockshare.ch or whatever the .thing is. Any of the sites that www.letmewatchthis.ch brings you to.
Does anybody know the cure for a melted face? Seen many doctors but nothing till now
